I used to have this terrible old website I’d made after watching a few YouTube tutorials. It had a space-y background I’d made in Paint, and at the top it had my name in shiny blue WordArt. I added a bunch of random stuff to it, like a log-in at the top that was completely nonfunctional and obnoxious marquee text. I’d employed the best security measures: a JavaScript snippet that would create a pop-up alert if you tried to right click on the page. Occasionally I’d make three sentence posts about whatever I was up to at the time. I guess 6th grade me didn’t have much to talk about, because I only updated it five times. After winter break was over, I forgot about it.

It’s winter again. I remembered my old website. I remembered all those old Angelfire websites I used to browse too. I felt kind of nostalgic, though I didn’t quite understand why. After all, how could anyone miss those gaudy eye-sores?

This time next year I’ll know where I’m going to college and the next part of my life will unfold without my consent. It’s kind of crazy how slowly time can move in the present, and how quickly it can zoom away when you glance at the past.

So what am I doing right now? I’m sitting in a poorly lit room writing this post and listening to a MIDI rendition of 99 Luftballons on repeat. 

I had a checklist of things I wanted to finish this weekend; it’s Sunday night and I’ve done none of those things. I guess I’d better get started.
