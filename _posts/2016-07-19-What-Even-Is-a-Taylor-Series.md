So most functions that are "nice enough" have a Taylor series expansion. Instead of dealing with some crazy function like sin(ln(1/x)), we can just use a polynomial that approximates it reasonably well. This is nice; we like polynomials. Here's the expansion of the function I mentioned earlier:

Wow! I feel better already.
